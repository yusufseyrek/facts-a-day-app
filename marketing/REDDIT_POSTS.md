What's in it:
- Offline reading (facts download in background)
- 3 trivia modes including one based on facts you've seen
- 8 languages
- Dark mode, clean UI

Free with no subscription. Would love feedback!

**Title:** I built a daily facts + trivia app to solve my own problem of never remembering what I read

**Post:**

Hey r/sideproject!

I'm that person who reads random facts at night and forgets everything by morning. Finally decided to build something about it.

**Facts a Day** gives you daily facts based on topics you choose, then quizzes you on them later. The trivia part was key because passive reading vs. active recall is a huge difference.

**Tech stack:** React Native (Expo), Tamagui, Expo Router

**What I learned:**
- Offline-first was worth the extra effort
- Multilingual from day one (8 languages) opened up way more users than expected
- Simple > feature-packed

It's free on both iOS and Android!

Happy to answer any questions about the build!

**Title:** [Self-Promotion Saturday] Made a daily facts app with offline support and trivia

**Post:**

Happy Saturday! Wanted to share an app I just released.

**Facts a Day** - you pick topics, get daily facts with nice visuals, and there's trivia to test if you actually retained anything. 

Built it because I kept reading random facts and forgetting them immediately lol.

Few highlights:
- Works fully offline
- Trivia based on facts you've seen
- Supports Dynamic Type and Dark Mode
- 8 languages

Free on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facts-a-day-daily-trivia/id6755321394

Would appreciate any feedback from the community!

## r/productivity

> **Rules to know:** Focus on the productivity/habit angle. Avoid being too salesy. Provide value in the post itself.

**Title:** I built an app to turn random fact-reading into an actual learning habit

**Post:**

Anyone else read interesting stuff and forget it immediately?

I realized the issue was passive consumption. Reading ≠ learning. So I built a small app called **Facts a Day** that:

1. Sends you daily facts on topics you choose
2. Quizzes you on them later (active recall)
3. Tracks your streaks and accuracy

The trivia component changed everything for me. Having to actually recall information makes it stick way better than just scrolling.

Works offline too, so I use it on my commute.

Free on iOS and Android:
- iOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facts-a-day-daily-trivia/id6755321394
- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.seyrek.factsaday

Curious if anyone else uses active recall for casual learning?

**Title:** Made a free app that uses active recall for learning random facts

**Post:**

Hey! I'm a big believer in active recall for studying, and I wanted to apply it to casual learning too.

Built **Facts a Day** which gives you daily facts on topics you pick (science, history, etc.) and then quizzes you on them. The trivia is based on what you've actually read, so it's like spaced repetition but for random knowledge.

Not meant to replace Anki or anything serious, but it's a nice way to learn something new each day without it going in one ear and out the other.

Free on iOS and Android:
- iOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facts-a-day-daily-trivia/id6755321394
- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.seyrek.factsaday

Anyone else use recall-based apps for non-academic learning?

**Title:** Made an app for people who love random facts but forget them 5 minutes later

**Post:**

You know when you learn that honey never spoils or that octopuses have three hearts, and then completely forget it when you actually want to impress someone?

Yeah, I got tired of that.

So I made **Facts a Day** - daily random facts + trivia to quiz yourself. Now I can actually remember useless knowledge when I need it at parties.

Free on iOS and Android:
- iOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facts-a-day-daily-trivia/id6755321394
- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.seyrek.factsaday

What's the most useless fact you know?

## r/trivia

**Title:** Built a daily trivia app that quizzes you on facts you've learned

**Post:**

Hey trivia lovers!

Made an app called **Facts a Day** that combines daily facts with trivia games.

The twist: the "Daily Trivia" mode specifically tests you on facts you've recently seen in the app, so it's actually checking if you learned something.

Also has:
- Mixed trivia (random from all topics)
- Category trivia (focus on what you like)
- Progress tracking with accuracy stats

Free on iOS and Android:
- iOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facts-a-day-daily-trivia/id6755321394
- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.seyrek.factsaday

What trivia categories would you want to see?

**Title:** Shipped my first production app with Expo + Tamagui - a daily facts app with trivia

**Post:**

Hey RN community! Just shipped **Facts a Day** to the App Store and wanted to share.

**Stack:**
- Expo (managed workflow)
- Expo Router for navigation
- Tamagui for UI/theming
- AsyncStorage for persistence
- i18n-js for 8 languages

**Things that worked well:**
- Tamagui's theme system made dark/light mode trivial
- Expo Router's file-based routing is so clean
- Offline-first approach with background fact syncing

**Challenges:**
- Getting Tamagui fonts to work correctly took some debugging
- Notification scheduling edge cases on iOS

It's a daily facts app with trivia games. Nothing revolutionary but happy to have shipped something!

**Title:** After months of side-project work, finally shipped my first app - Facts a Day

**Post:**

Hey fellow indie devs!

Finally hit publish on my first real app: **Facts a Day**.

It's a simple concept: daily facts on topics you choose + trivia to test yourself. Nothing groundbreaking, but I'm proud I actually finished something for once.

**What I learned:**
- Scope creep is real. Had to cut features multiple times.
- Launching is scary but waiting for "perfect" is worse
- Offline support was way more work than expected but users love it

Now live on both iOS and Android!

Would love to connect with other solo devs. What are you working on?

3. **Upvote and comment on other posts** - be a community member first
4. **Check each sub's current top posts** - match the tone
5. **Post timing matters** - best times are 9-11am EST on weekdays
6. **If a post flops, don't delete** - just move on to the next sub
7. **Build karma first** - spend a week commenting before promoting
