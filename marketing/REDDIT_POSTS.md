**Title:** I built a daily facts + trivia app to solve my own problem of never remembering what I read

**Post:**

Hey r/sideproject!

I'm that person who reads random facts at night and forgets everything by morning. Finally decided to build something about it.

**Facts a Day** gives you daily facts based on topics you choose, then quizzes you on them later. The trivia part was key because passive reading vs. active recall is a huge difference.

**Tech stack:** React Native (Expo), Tamagui, Expo Router

**What I learned:**
- Offline-first was worth the extra effort
- Multilingual from day one (8 languages) opened up way more users than expected
- Simple > feature-packed

It's free on both iOS and Android!

**Title:** [Self-Promotion Saturday] Made a daily facts app with offline support and trivia

**Post:**

Happy Saturday! Wanted to share an app I just released.

**Facts a Day** - you pick topics, get daily facts with nice visuals, and there's trivia to test if you actually retained anything. 

Built it because I kept reading random facts and forgetting them immediately lol.

Few highlights:
- Works fully offline
- Trivia based on facts you've seen
- Supports Dynamic Type and Dark Mode
- 8 languages

Free on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facts-a-day-daily-trivia/id6755321394

Would appreciate any feedback from the community!

**Title:** I built an app to turn random fact-reading into an actual learning habit

**Post:**

Anyone else read interesting stuff and forget it immediately?

I realized the issue was passive consumption. Reading ≠ learning. So I built a small app called **Facts a Day** that:

1. Sends you daily facts on topics you choose
2. Quizzes you on them later (active recall)
3. Tracks your streaks and accuracy

The trivia component changed everything for me. Having to actually recall information makes it stick way better than just scrolling.

Works offline too, so I use it on my commute.

Curious if anyone else uses active recall for casual learning?

**Title:** Made a free app that uses active recall for learning random facts

**Post:**

Hey! I'm a big believer in active recall for studying, and I wanted to apply it to casual learning too.

Built **Facts a Day** which gives you daily facts on topics you pick (science, history, etc.) and then quizzes you on them. The trivia is based on what you've actually read, so it's like spaced repetition but for random knowledge.

Not meant to replace Anki or anything serious, but it's a nice way to learn something new each day without it going in one ear and out the other.

**Title:** Made an app for people who love random facts but forget them 5 minutes later

**Post:**

You know when you learn that honey never spoils or that octopuses have three hearts, and then completely forget it when you actually want to impress someone?

Yeah, I got tired of that.

So I made **Facts a Day** - daily random facts + trivia to quiz yourself. Now I can actually remember useless knowledge when I need it at parties.

## r/trivia

**Title:** Built a daily trivia app that quizzes you on facts you've learned

**Post:**

Hey trivia lovers!

Made an app called **Facts a Day** that combines daily facts with trivia games.

The twist: the "Daily Trivia" mode specifically tests you on facts you've recently seen in the app, so it's actually checking if you learned something.

Also has:
- Mixed trivia (random from all topics)
- Category trivia (focus on what you like)
- Progress tracking with accuracy stats

**Title:** Shipped my first production app with Expo + Tamagui - a daily facts app with trivia

**Post:**

Hey RN community! Just shipped **Facts a Day** to the App Store and wanted to share.

**Stack:**
- Expo (managed workflow)
- Expo Router for navigation
- Tamagui for UI/theming
- AsyncStorage for persistence
- i18n-js for 8 languages

**Things that worked well:**
- Tamagui's theme system made dark/light mode trivial
- Expo Router's file-based routing is so clean
- Offline-first approach with background fact syncing

**Challenges:**
- Getting Tamagui fonts to work correctly took some debugging
- Notification scheduling edge cases on iOS

It's a daily facts app with trivia games. Nothing revolutionary but happy to have shipped something!

**Post:**

Hey fellow indie devs!

Finally hit publish on my first real app: **Facts a Day**.

It's a simple concept: daily facts on topics you choose + trivia to test yourself. Nothing groundbreaking, but I'm proud I actually finished something for once.

**What I learned:**
- Scope creep is real. Had to cut features multiple times.
- Launching is scary but waiting for "perfect" is worse
- Offline support was way more work than expected but users love it

Now live on both iOS and Android!

## General Tips

1. **Engage with every comment** - Reddit rewards genuine interaction

3. **Upvote and comment on other posts** - be a community member first
4. **Check each sub's current top posts** - match the tone
5. **Post timing matters** - best times are 9-11am EST on weekdays
6. **If a post flops, don't delete** - just move on to the next sub
7. **Build karma first** - spend a week commenting before promoting

Hey r/TestFlight!

I know this sub is usually for betas, but I wanted to reach out to this community specifically because you all give such thoughtful feedback.

My app **Facts a Day** is now live on the App Store, and I'm planning my next update. Before I build more features, I'd really love to hear what actual users think.

- Trivia games that test you on what you've read
- Works fully offline
- 8 languages, dark mode, clean UI

**What would help me most:**
- Honest first impressions
- What's confusing or annoying?
- What would make you keep using it?
- App Store review if you think it deserves one

I'm a solo dev, so every piece of feedback genuinely shapes what I build next.

## r/betatest

**Title:** [Feedback Request] Facts a Day is live - indie dev looking for honest opinions

**Post:**

Hey everyone!

My app **Facts a Day** just launched on iOS and Android, and I'm looking for honest feedback from people who regularly test and review apps.

**The concept:**
You pick topics you're interested in → get daily facts with images → play trivia to see if you actually remember anything. It's for people who love learning random stuff but forget everything immediately (like me).

**Why I'm posting here:**
This community gives real, constructive feedback. I'm not looking for "nice app!" - I want to know:
- What's the first thing that frustrated you?
- Did you understand what to do without instructions?
- Would you open this app again tomorrow? Why or why not?
- Is the trivia too easy, too hard, or just right?

**What I'm offering:**
- A free, ad-light app (no subscription, no paywall)
- I actually read and respond to every comment
- Your feedback will directly influence the next update

**Download:**
- iOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facts-a-day-daily-trivia/id6755321394
- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.seyrek.factsaday

If you have a few minutes to try it and share your thoughts, it would mean a lot. And if you think it's worth it, an App Store/Play Store review would be incredibly helpful for visibility.

Thanks! 🙏

**Post:**

**App:** Facts a Day  
**Status:** Live on App Store & Play Store  
**Price:** Free (no subscription)

Daily facts app with a learning twist. Instead of just reading and forgetting, it quizzes you on facts you've seen. Pick your categories (science, history, nature, space, tech, etc.), get fresh facts daily, then test yourself with trivia.

**Why I need your help:**

I'm a solo developer and I've hit that stage where I need outside perspectives. I've been staring at this app for months and I can't see it objectively anymore.

**Specifically looking for:**
- First-time user experience feedback
- UI/UX pain points
- Feature suggestions
- Honest reviews on the stores (good or critical - both help)

**Title:** Solo dev here - Facts a Day is live and I'd love your brutally honest feedback

**Post:**

Hey r/iOSapps!

I just launched **Facts a Day** and I'm at that scary stage where I need real user opinions.

**What it is:**
Daily facts app + trivia. You pick topics, get facts with nice visuals, and quiz yourself to actually remember what you read. Simple concept, hopefully well executed.

**Features:**
- Offline support (facts sync in background)
- 3 trivia modes
- 8 languages
- Dark mode, clean design
- Free, no subscription

**What I'm asking:**
- Try it for 5 minutes
- Tell me what sucks (seriously, I can take it)
- If you like it, an App Store review would help more than you know

As a solo dev with zero marketing budget, reviews are basically my only way to get discovered. Even a one-line review makes a difference.

Hey indie devs!

I finally shipped **Facts a Day** and now comes the hard part - getting people to actually try it.

**The app:**
Daily facts on topics you pick + trivia games to test your recall. Built it because I love learning random things but never remember them.

- Reviews on the stores are basically my only discovery mechanism

## Tips for Feedback/Review Requests

1. **Be genuine** - people can smell fake humility
2. **Ask for specific feedback** - "what's confusing?" beats "any thoughts?"
3. **Acknowledge you want reviews** - being upfront is better than hinting
4. **Offer reciprocity** - especially in dev communities
5. **Respond to every comment** - even negative ones, especially negative ones
6. **Don't spam** - space out your posts across days/weeks
7. **Follow up** - if someone gives good feedback, thank them publicly
